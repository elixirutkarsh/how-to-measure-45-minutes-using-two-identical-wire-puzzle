# how-to-measure-45-minutes-using-two-identical-wire-puzzle

solution:
1)Take both identical wires and light them simultaneously from one end.

2)Let one wire burn completely, which will take 30 minutes.

3)At this point, the second wire will have 30 minutes of burn time remaining.

4)Now, light the other end of the second wire.

5)The remaining 30 minutes of burn time will be completed in 15 minutes.

By lighting both wires at the same time, one wire burns for 30 minutes, and the other wire burns for 15 minutes, totaling 45 minutes.
